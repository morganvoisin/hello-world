This repository is for practising on the GitHub Flow. I'm a self-taught stendent with basic knowledge so far. I'm considering re-enrolling in college to work on learning more and possibly changing career. I currently work for 911 but eventually want to get into either cybersecurity or some type of security software development. I have heavy interests in chaotic situations, specifically finding creative solutions to abstract problems. My journey may have just started, but the first steps are always the hardest.
